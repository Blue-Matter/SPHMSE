\arguments{
\item{x}{Integer, simulation number}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (not used)}

\item{delta}{Vector length 2, minimum and maximum change in CBA (applied at the last step of the CBA calculation). Set to \code{c(0, Inf)} to remove the hyperrule.}

\item{CBA_previous}{Numeric, the CBA in the previous year, used to calculate the CBA for the following year. Only used if \code{max(Data@Year) == Data@LHYear}.
If not provided, uses a value of 41.4 t (2022 CBA).}

\item{type_par}{A control parameter for the interim procedure. See details.}

\item{y}{Integer, length of years for calculating the trend, i.e., slope, in the index}

\details{
Sin_Pesca: No fishing reference MP, effort-based and thus will not be subject to CBA implementation error

Manejo_Perfecto: Perfect management is an effort-based MP and thus will not be subject to CBA implementation error
MP specifies the fishing effort that corresponds to 95 percent FMSY
In openMSE, the effort is relative to the last historical year of the operating model.
Effort can also be more efficient/powerful in the projection
This code ensures that the correct fishing mortality is specified regardless of the
improvement in the fishing effort, based on \code{MSEtool::FMSYref()}

PM_A fits an assessment model and applies the low-compliance control rule for the CBA

PM_B fits an assessment model and applies the high-compliance control rule for the CBA

PM_C fits an assessment model and applies the ramped harvest control rule for the CBA

PM_A_interim fits an assessment model once every three years with the low-compliance control rule for the CBA.
In the intervening years, an adjustment is made based on new index values. See details below. In each year, the hyperrule is
applied at the last step.

PM_B_interim fits an assessment model once every three years with the high-compliance control rule for the CBA.
In the intervening years, an adjustment is made based on new index values. See details below.

PM_A_interim fits an assessment model once every three years with the ramped control rule for the CBA.
In the intervening years, an adjustment is made based on new index values. See details below.

I3 is an index-based management procedure proposed by SSPA (slope over 3 years)

I5 is an index-based management procedure proposed by SSPA (slope over 5 years)

I3_lambda1 is an index-based management procedure proposed by SSPA (slope over 3 years with symmetric lambda)

I5_lambda1 is an index-based management procedure proposed by SSPA (slope over 5 years with symmetric lambda)

\section{Model-based MPs}{

Model-based MPs use the RCM model (coded in TMB). By default, the RCM object developed from data to 2023 is located in \code{SPHenv$RCM_hake}.
To update the model for the MP, replace \code{SPHenv$RCM_hake} with a new \code{RCModel-class} object.
}

\section{Interim MP}{

The interim procedure updates the CBA according to index observations between periodic
assessment intervals. \strong{Always ensure to set:} \code{OM@interval <- 1}. The actual assessment frequency is specified in function argument for each
management procedure (argument \code{assessment_interval}).

In the year when the assessment is applied, the CBA is set by fitting the model and then running the harvest control rule.

Between assessments, the CBA is updated as
\deqn{
\textrm{CBA}_{y+1} = C_{\textrm{ref}} (I_y + b \times s)/(I_{\textrm{ref}} + b \times s)
}
where \code{Cref} is the CBA calculated from the most recent assessment, \code{Iref} is the value of the index when \code{Cref} was calculated
(see Equations 6 and 7 of Huynh et al. 2020). The value of \code{I_y} depends on \code{type}, with \code{b} and \code{s} equal zero unless
\code{type = "buffer"}:

\itemize{
\item \code{"buffer"} - \code{I_y} is the most recent index with \code{b} is specifed by \code{type_par} (default = 1), and \code{s} is
the standard deviation of index residuals from the most recent assessment.
\item \code{"mean"} - \code{I_y} is the mean value of the index over the most recent \code{type_par} years (default = 3).
\item \code{"loess"} - \code{I_y} is the most recent index predicted by a \link[stats:loess]{loess} smoother applied over the entire time series of the index.
Use \code{type_par} to adjust the \code{span} parameter (default = 0.75).
\item \code{"none"} - \code{I_y} is the most recent index. Index values are not adjusted in the interim procedure.
